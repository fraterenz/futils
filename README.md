Loading and processing data generated by stochastic simulations with different sets of parameters.

We first load the data generated by the simulations. Once the data have been loaded, we process them to make them comparable and understand the impact of the parameters on the data generated.

We consider two main file formats:

1. a json file representing a snapshot of a simulation at a certain timepoint (see `src/snapshot.py`)
2. a csv file containing the evolution of a simulated quantity (see `src/timeserie.py`)
